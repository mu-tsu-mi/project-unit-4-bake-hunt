# BAKE HUNT

Welcome to Bake Hunt app. A patisserie app where you can select cakes in your cart and make an order for pick-up. I conjured up this app idea from my previous experience and passion working as a baker, and my current enthusiasm becoming a web developer. I have made this app using the knowledge I learnt from General Assemblyâ€™s bootcamp course. I am keen to continue adding more features.
